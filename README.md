## Why FileSecureSuite?

Encryption should be frictionless. Most people need to encrypt files and texts for ad-hoc secure sharing via email or chat—but existing solutions were built for different problems.

**The Challenge:**
Initially, we explored OpenSSL for encryption. It's mature and widely used, but it has a critical limitation: **RSA key size directly constrains file size**. Encrypting large files (beyond a few MB) with OpenSSL keys becomes impractical. **GPG** solves this but is designed around permanent key management, trust networks, and identity verification—concepts that add overhead for simpler use cases.

**Our Solution:**
FileSecureSuite uses **hybrid encryption**, optimized for:

- **Throwaway keys** - Generate a key for a single conversation, then discard it. No persistent key management burden.
- **Large file support** - Hybrid encryption (AES-256-GCM + RSA-4096) scales to any file size limited only by available RAM, not key size.
- **OpenSSL key compatibility** - You can use OpenSSL-generated RSA keys with FileSecureSuite for encryption. However, encrypted files are in **FSS1 format** (FileSecureSuite's published standard), which requires FileSecureSuite or a compatible implementation to decrypt.
- **Speed** - Encrypt a file in seconds, without setup complexity. Create keys on the fly.
- **Privacy** - Keys don't linger in your system. Communicate securely without maintaining infrastructure.
- **Simplicity** - Drag & drop encryption on Windows, intuitive workflows on all platforms. No learning curve.
- **Archive protection** - Encrypt sensitive files at rest without needing signatures or trust networks.

### Open Format Specification

To ensure files encrypted today remain decryptable in the future—whether FileSecureSuite exists or not—we've published **complete encryption specifications** documenting all parameters, format details, and test vectors. This enables independent implementations in any language and guarantees long-term interoperability.

### Not Trying to Replace, Just Different

FileSecureSuite doesn't aim to be a replacement for GPG or OpenSSL. It's a purpose-built tool for a specific workflow: **quick, temporary, easy encryption for everyday file sharing and storage**. 

If you need digital signatures, long-term key infrastructure, or trusted communication networks—GPG is the right choice. If you need to securely share a document in 30 seconds without complexity—FileSecureSuite is built for that.

### Flexible Encryption for Every Scenario

FileSecureSuite doesn't lock you into one approach. Choose what fits your need:

- **Password-only encryption** - Encrypt a file/text with a simple password using AES-256-GCM. Share the file/text and password separately. Perfect for quick, one-off exchanges.
- **Throwaway key pairs** - Generate a temporary RSA key pair, share the public key, encrypt the file/text, then discard the key after communication. No password needed, no lingering infrastructure.
- **Long-term key protection** - Create an RSA keypair, protect it with a strong password, and use it to encrypt your archive files. One secure key manages all your sensitive data without complexity.

Same tool, different modes—you decide the right security model for each situation.

### Key Principles

- **User-first design** - Encryption operations should feel as natural as sharing a file
- **Open format specification** - All encryption parameters published for future interoperability and independent implementations
- **Cross-platform** - Seamless experience on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Self-contained** - Everything you need is integrated—no external tool juggling
- **Future-proof** - Security enhancements planned without breaking backward compatibility
